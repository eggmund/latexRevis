\textbf{Strong Force}

The strong force is {\textbf{repulsive}} at distances $< 0.5$ fm, and {\textbf{attractive}} at distances $> 0.5$ fm to $3$ fm.

The strong force in the nucleus has to be stronger (overall) than the EM force to keep the nucleus together, as the protons in the nucleus are all repelling each other proton in the nucleus, where as the strong force is much more attractive for the nucleons around it, but has pretty much no effect on other nucleons.
